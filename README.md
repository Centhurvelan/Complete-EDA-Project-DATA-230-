## Project Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and results for a complete EDA pipeline, focused on extracting insights from a dataset provided for DATA 230. The project covers data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and initial statistical analysis.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Statistical summaries and insights
- Notebook-based workflow (Jupyter, Colab, etc.)
- Reproducible results

## Data Sources

- [Describe your dataset here, including the source, citation, and any relevant details.]
- Example: `data/dataset.csv`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Centhurvelan/Complete-EDA-Project-DATA-230-.git
    cd Complete-EDA-Project-DATA-230-
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   (Assuming you use Python and requirements.txt)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## Usage

- Open the main analysis notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
    ```
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis step by step.
